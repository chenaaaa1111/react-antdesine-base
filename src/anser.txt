      For the rich and famous, divorce American-style can cost millions in legal fees and drag on for years. Dissolving a marriage is emotionally draining, but does it have to be expensive and time-consuming as well? The average American divorce can cost between 15000and20000 for legal help, and an offer takes more than a year to finalize. 
      “Point, Click and Split” – Christine and Andrew Brodigan of Seattle found a cheap and quick alternative – divorce on line. 
       “We are about to answer our last few questions for our divorce,” Christine Brodigan said as she began the online process recently. “Divorce isn’t easy, but this sure made a huge difference in not having to deal with a lot of stuff that normal people would have to go through.” 
      Using an online site, www.completecase.com, the Brodingans were able to end their nine-year union with just a credit card and the click of a mouse. 
      “Generally, these are people who are not going to see the inside of a lawyer’s office anyway,” said Randy Finney, a Seattle divorce lawyer who is the founder and CEO of Completecase.com. “These are people who either can’t afford or don’t want to hire an attorney.” 
      It cost the Brodigans ＄249 and took about 30 minutes– “Very cost-effective for us,” said Andrew Brodigan, as his ex-wife agreed “In our situation, we didn’t have a lot of money to deal with anyway,” Andrew Brodigan added. 
      On the site, designed only for uncontested divorces, couples like the Brodigans can find ready-made divorce forms, complete with answers to frequently asked questions. 
       At the end of their online process the Brodigans saw a final message on their computer screen: “It said, ‘Attention, you have reached the end of question – answer process,’ ” Christine and Andrew could print, sign and mail their forms to the judge. 
      “Lawyer: Site Doesn’t Cheapen Marriage”. Finney believes his site provides a needed service to troubled couples, and doesn’t cheapen the institution of marriage.
